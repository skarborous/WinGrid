# WinGrid (Window Grid Overlay)

WinGrid! 🎉 Your trusty companion for transforming your screen into a beautifully organized grid of awesomeness. This WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application is designed to provide a customizable grid overlay that not only makes your screen look snazzy but also helps you manage your chaos—whether you're designing, visualizing, or just need a little structure to your digital life (we see you, fellow OCD warriors! 😄).

WinGrid runs in fullscreen mode and with a transparent background, which means you can still interact with your other applications while basking in the grid-tastic glory!

## Features
- Customizable Grid Spacing.
- Adjustable Transparency.
- Exact Fit Mode: Automatically adjusts grid spacing to fit the current screen dimensions precisely—because who doesn’t love a perfect fit? (No, not that kind of fit. Get your mind out of the gutter! 😜)
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple controls for easy interaction—because no one has time for complicated setups.
- Fullscreen and Topmost: The application occupies the entire screen and remains above all other windows, like that annoying banner ad you can’t escape (but way cooler).

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
- bash
```
git clone https://github.com/skarborous/WinGrid.git
cd WinGrid
```
- Open the solution in Visual Studio. (Make sure you’ve got the .NET Framework installed—because it’s the law of the land!)
- Build and run the application. Watch in awe as your screen transforms into a grid paradise!

## Usage
- Launch the application. (It’s ready to rock!)
- Use the sliders to adjust the grid line spacing and transparency. Go wild!
- Enable or disable the Exact Fit mode to see how it affects the grid layout—because we all like a little flexibility in our lives!
- Click "Quit" to close the application. But let’s be honest, you won’t want to leave this grid party! 🎊
